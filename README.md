# Crime Analysis and Prediction

## Overview

This project aims to provide comprehensive analysis and insights into crime patterns and trends using various techniques such as map-based analysis, month-based analysis, age-based analysis, crime prediction, crime sentiment analysis, and a model for resource allocation, crime prediction, sentiment analysis for social media comments for finding probable criminal activities.

## Features

### Map-Based Analysis

- Utilizes maps to visualize crime hotspots, aiding in understanding geographic patterns of criminal activities.
- Provides detailed views of crime distribution across different regions, enabling targeted interventions and resource allocation.

### Month-Based Analysis

- Analyzes crime data based on months to identify seasonal trends and variations in criminal activities.
- Helps in understanding temporal patterns and planning preventive measures accordingly.

### Age-Based Analysis

- Focuses on age demographics to study crime trends for women and sensitive age groups like the elderly and children.
- Provides insights into vulnerable age categories and potential areas for social interventions.

### Crime Predictor

- Utilizes machine learning models to predict potential crime occurrences based on historical data and relevant factors.
- Aids law enforcement agencies in proactive planning and resource allocation.

### Crime Sentiment Analysis

- Analyzes public sentiment related to crime through social media and other sources.
- Provides a sentiment score to gauge public perception and concerns regarding safety and security.

### Resource Allocation Model

- A model for finding the nearest police station containing needed resources for the user-reported crime.
- Maximizes efficiency in resource utilization and response to varying crime scenarios.

### Criminal prediction Model

- A model for predicting the most probable criminals based on the previous data for criminals including the time range, the locations of the crimes, and the crime type.
